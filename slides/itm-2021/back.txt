> CDA locks you into documents, and documents are not the ideal way to access
  a whole lot of data.
  If your question is "how has the patient's blood pressure trended over time"
  or "what are a patient's allergies",
  wading through a ton of documents is difficult for both humans and technology.

* Documents just give you the paper problem in electronic form. It's the equivalent of a file folder that's a foot thick that lets you do some simple searches on top of - not efficient for a lot of things, so you end up with a bunch of data that isn't truly accessible
* Documents are purpose-specific. REST is generic. So once you have a REST endpoint, it can be used for a wide variety of things. Also, migrating data between different forms is hard
* CDA is based on v3, which suffers from a number of limitations
  *  experts are few and far between (and declining in numbers)
  *  the syntax is obtuse and non-intuitive for most implementers
  *  there's no built in extensibility capability
  *  there's often multiple ways to say the same thing, so interoperability is harder without pre-negotiation

FHIR brings a lot of benefits
* can use JSON rather than just XML
* integrated support for sophisticated profiling and terminology services
* open source implementations in a wide variety of technologies
* a huge and responsive international support community

CDA itself has said that their next major version is going to be based on FHIR
and all of their content will be published using FHIR tooling.
So your forward path is going to end up being FHIR
even if you start with CDA - therefore why not embrace all of FHIR from the start?

Personally: I have don't spend time on CDA.
I guess I do see some role for "here's a self contained document with a full encounter history",
but it hasn't been the thing I've needed

### ONC

* ~ 2010 CCDA
* 2015 SMART on FHIR
* 2018 Blue Button (FHIR)
* 2020 Payers API
* 2022 SMART on FHIR 2

ONC initially proposed to adopt the HL7 FHIR standard as a foundational standard and
requested comment on four options to determine the best version of FHIR to adopt.
Finally, ONC adopted FHIR Release 4.
